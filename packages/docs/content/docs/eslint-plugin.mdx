## Installation

Install eslint-plugin-yak in your project:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
<Tab value="npm">
```bash
npm install -D eslint-plugin-yak
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm i -D eslint-plugin-yak
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="yarn">
```bash
yarn i -D eslint-plugin-yak
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="bun">
```bash
bun i -D eslint-plugin-yak
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

Add it to your eslint config:

```js title="eslint.config.mjs"
import yakPlugin from "eslint-plugin-yak";
import { defineConfig } from "eslint/config";

export default defineConfig([
  yakPlugin.configs.recommended,
]);
```

Now, you can run eslint to check your code.

```ts
const myDiv = styled.div`
    > div {}
`;
// ^ eslint: Nesting selector missing. Did you forget the &?
```

## Rules

### css-nesting-operator

Enforces css selectors in next-yak to correctly use the [nesting selector (&)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Nesting_selector).

Example:

```tsx title="example.tsx"
const myDiv = styled.div`
 //[!code --]
 > div {}
 //[!code ++]
 & > div {}
`;
```

#### Reason why

Unlike in `styled-components`, the nesting selector is required to be used in order to correctly scope styles.

We didn't want this magic to be in `next-yak` as writing styles should feel as natural and as close to vanilla CSS as possible.

### enforce-semicolon

Enforces semicolons after a mixin, to make distinguishing between mixins and nested selectors easier.

Example:

```tsx title="example.tsx"
styled.div`
//[!code --]
  ${skeletonStyle}
//[!code ++]
  ${skeletonStyle};
`;
```

#### Reason why

Unlike runtime CSS-in-JS libraries that combine strings at execution time, `next-yak` has to understand the code statically. A variable might have different meanings:

- **Selectors** (like `${Button} div { color: blue }`) define styling rules for components
- **Mixins** (like `${skeletonMixin};`) inject pre-defined CSS rules
- **Constants** (like `margin-top: ${marginTop}`)
- **Runtime Variables** (like `x: ${({$x}) => $x}`)

Constants and runtime values are easy to detect as they are always after a colon (:).
However to distinguish between selectors and mixins we need the semicolon (;):

```tsx
// This works correctly - mixin properly terminated with semicolon
styled.div`
  ${skeleton};
  div {
    color: blue;
  }
`

// This causes ambiguity - is it a mixin or part of the selector?
styled.div`
  ${skeleton}
  div {
    color: blue;
  }
`
```

### style-conditions

Warns if runtime performance could be improved by using css literals.

Example:

```tsx title="example.tsx"
styled.button`
//[!code --]
  color: ${() => color};
//[!code ++]
  color: ${({$color}) => $color};
// or if the value is defined outside the component: // [!code ++]
//[!code ++]
  color: ${color};
`;
```

```tsx title="example.tsx"
styled.button`
  color: ${() => {
    if (variant === 'primary') {
      return primary; // [!code --]
      return css` // [!code ++]
        color: ${({$primary}) => $primary}; // [!code ++]
      `; // [!code ++]
      // or if the value is defined outside the component: // [!code ++]
      return css` // [!code ++]
        color: ${primary}; // [!code ++]
      `; // [!code ++]
    } else {
      return secondary; // [!code --]
      return css` // [!code ++]
        color: ${({$secondary}) => $secondary}; // [!code ++]
      `; // [!code ++]
      // or if the value is defined outside the component: // [!code ++]
      return css` // [!code ++]
        color: ${secondary}; // [!code ++]
      `; // [!code ++]
    }
  }};
`;
```

#### Reason why

next-yak offers two different approaches for implementing dynamic styles, each with its own use cases and performance characteristics.

<Steps>
<Step>
Class-based Dynamic Styles:

The first approach compiles dynamic styles into separate CSS classes that are toggled at runtime:

```tsx
styled.button<{$primary?: boolean}>`
  color: blue;
  ${({$primary}) => $primary && css`
    color: red;
  `}
`;
```

In this example:
- The base style color: blue is extracted into a CSS class that's always applied
- The conditional style color: red is extracted into a separate CSS class that's only toggled based on the $primary prop
- This approach is highly efficient since all styles are pre-compiled and only class names are manipulated at runtime
</Step>

<Step>
CSS Variables for Truly Dynamic Values

The second approach uses CSS custom properties (variables) for values that cannot be determined at build time:

```tsx
styled.div<{$x: number}>`
  left: ${({$x}) => `${$x}px`}
`;
```

In this example:

- The value for $x is extracted into a CSS variable (e.g., --x)
- At runtime, this variable is set via inline styles: `<div style="--x: 43px">...</div>`
- This allows for fully dynamic values but adds a small runtime overhead
</Step>
</Steps>

#### Best Practices

- Use the class-based approach (first example) for binary conditions and fixed value variations
- Use CSS variables (second example) only when values are truly dynamic, such as:
  - User inputs
  - Calculated positions
  - Animation states
  - Values from external APIs

The yak/style-conditions rule in our linting tools can help identify unnecessary uses of CSS variables, keeping your HTML smaller and more performant.
