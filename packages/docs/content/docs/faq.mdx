## Is next-yak production ready?

`next-yak` is still experimental but we are working hard to release a stable 1.0 version

## Can I use next-yak with other frameworks than next.js?

Not by now - feel free to ask for adding support for your framework in our github issue tracker and we will give it a thought.

## Can I mix/combine next-yak with other CSS-in-JS libraries?

Yes, you can use next-yak with other CSS-in-JS libraries. You can use it with styled-components, emotion, or any other library that 
adds css classes to your components.

## Can I reference a component in another component?

Yes, you can reference it in the tagged template literal. 
```jsx
import { styled } from 'next-yak';

const Button = styled.button`
	background: #BF4F74;
`;

const Nav = styled.nav`
	background: #BF4F74;
	${Button} {
		color: white;
	}
`;
```


<Callout>
This doesn't work for components outside of the current file, as next-yak only considers one file at a time.
</Callout>

## Why does next-yak always generate CSS variables when the values are static references that are known at build time?

It's very hard to determine if a value is static or dynamic. We decided to always generate CSS variables to be on the safe side
and add errors if we detect that a value is static but a CSS variable is used.

## Can I use next-yak with TypeScript?

Yes, of course. `next-yak` is fully type safe.

## Can I contribute to next-yak?

Yes, of course. We are happy about every contribution. Just write an issue or a pull request [here](https://github.com/jantimon/next-yak)
