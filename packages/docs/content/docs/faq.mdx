## Is next-yak production ready?

Yes, `next-yak` is production ready.

Digitec Galaxus, the biggest online retailer in Switzerland, is using `next-yak` in production with a few thousand components
and saw a significant improvement in their CSS and web vitals performance especially on mobile devices.

## Can I use next-yak with other frameworks than next.js?

Not at the moment.

Feel free to ask for adding support for your framework in our github issue tracker and we will give it a thought.

## Can I mix/combine next-yak with other CSS-in-JS libraries?

Yes, you can use next-yak with other CSS-in-JS libraries.

You can use it with styled-components, emotion, tailwind or any other library that adds css classes to your components.

```tsx title="my-component.tsx"
import { styled, atoms } from 'next-yak';

const Button = styled.button`
  background: #BF4F74;
  /* Use any other class */
  :global(.my-class-from-another-library) {
    color: white;
  }
  /* use tailwind classes */
  ${atoms("mx-auto flex max-w-7xl items-center justify-between p-6 lg:px-8")}
`;
```

## I get a compile time error in my app router page

At the moment, there is an issue with styles in files that use the [metadata api](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata) of next.js.

We have an open issue for this problem and are working on a solution.
See the [open next.js issue here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/67591)

If it's not this issue, please read it carefully as it should indicate how to fix the problem.

## Can I reference a component in another component?

Yes, you can reference it in the tagged template literal the same way you would to it with styled-components.

```jsx title="my-component.tsx"
import { styled } from 'next-yak';

const Button = styled.button`
	background: #BF4F74;
`;

const Nav = styled.nav`
	background: #BF4F74;
	${Button} {
		color: white;
	}
`;
```

## Why does next-yak always generate CSS variables when the values are static references that are known at build time?

It's very hard to determine statically if a value is static or dynamic. We decided to always generate CSS variables to be on the safe side
and add errors if we detect that a value is static but a CSS variable is used.

## Can I use next-yak with TypeScript?

Yes, `next-yak` is fully type safe.

## Can I contribute to next-yak?

Yes.

We are happy about every contribution. Just write an issue or a pull request [here](https://github.com/jantimon/next-yak)

## I get an error about selector that are not pure

If you get an error like this:

<Callout type="error">
Error: The selector "div" is not pure. It is not allowed to use a selector that is not pure.
</Callout>

You are using the outdated version of postcss-nested, that is automatically bundled with next.js.

You can update the dependency yourself by adding the package to your `package.json`:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
<Tab value="npm">
```bash
npm i postcss-nested
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm i postcss-nested
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="yarn">
```bash
yarn add postcss-nested
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="bun">
```bash
bun add postcss-nested
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

and create a `postcss.config.cjs` file in your project root with the following content:

```js title="postcss.config.cjs"
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    'postcss-nested': {},
  },
};
```

Or you can add an ampersand to the selector:

```jsx title="my-component.tsx"
import { styled } from 'next-yak';

const Button = styled.button`
  background: #BF4F74;
  & div {
    color: white;
  }
`;
```

so that the old version of postcss-nested does not complain about the selector.

For further information see the [issue on next-yak](https://github.com/jantimon/next-yak/issues/221) and the open [pull request on next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/72622).

## My styles are not applied

If your styles are not applied, the first thing you should check is the transformed output of your component.
In order to do that, you can enable the `debug` option in the `withYak` function.

<Tabs items={['next.config.ts',, 'next.config.js', 'next.config.mjs']}>
<Tab value="next.config.ts">
```ts
export default withYak({
  experiments: {
    debug: {
      filter: (path: string) => path.includes("myPage"),
      type: "all", // or "css" or "js"
    },
  },
}nextConfig);
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="next.config.js">
```js
module.exports = withYak({
  experiments: {
    debug: {
      filter: (path: string) => path.includes("myPage"),
      type: "all", // or "css" or "js"
    },
  },
}nextConfig);
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="next.config.mjs">
```js
export default withYak({
  experiments: {
    debug: {
      filter: (path: string) => path.includes("myPage"),
      type: "all", // or "css" or "js"
    },
  },
}nextConfig);
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

This will log the transformed output of your component to the console.

It could be a specificity issue, a wrong selector, or a wrong usage of the library and if you don't know why your styles are not applied, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/jantimon/next-yak/issues/new/choose).
