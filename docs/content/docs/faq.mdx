## Is next-yak production ready?

Yes, `next-yak` is production ready.

Digitec Galaxus, the biggest online retailer in Switzerland, is using `next-yak` in production with a few thousand components
and saw a significant improvement in their CSS and web vitals performance especially on mobile devices. You can read more about their journey in their [blog post](https://www.galaxus.ch/page/next-yak-innovation-made-in-zuerich-teil-2-37910).

## Can I use next-yak with other frameworks than Next.js?

Yes! Since v9.1.0, next-yak supports [Vite](/docs/vite) in addition to Next.js. This works with vanilla Vite, Vite with Rolldown, react-router, and tanstack-start.

Feel free to ask for adding support for other frameworks in our GitHub issue tracker and we will give it a thought.

## Can I mix/combine next-yak with other CSS-in-JS libraries?

Yes, you can use next-yak with other CSS-in-JS libraries.

You can use it with styled-components, emotion, tailwind or any other library that adds css classes to your components.

```tsx title="my-component.tsx"
import { styled, atoms } from 'next-yak';

const Button = styled.button`
  background: #BF4F74;
  /* Target classes from other libraries */
  & .my-class-from-another-library {
    color: white;
  }
  /* use tailwind classes */
  ${atoms("mx-auto flex max-w-7xl items-center justify-between p-6 lg:px-8")}
`;
```

If you're using the older `:global()` syntax, please migrate to native CSS transpilation mode. See the [Migration to native CSS](/docs/migration-to-native-css) guide for details.

## I get a compile time error in my app router page

At the moment, there is an issue with styles in files that use the [metadata api](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata) of next.js.

We have an open issue for this problem and are working on a solution.
See the [open next.js issue here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/67591)

If it's not this issue, please read it carefully as it should indicate how to fix the problem.

## I get an error about selector that are not pure

If you see an error like `Selector "h1" is not pure (pure selectors must contain at least one local class or id)`, this is coming from PostCSS and CSS Modules, not from next-yak directly.

This error occurs when you use element selectors (like `h1`, `div`, `p`) without scoping them properly. There are two ways to fix this:

**Option 1: Use the nesting selector (&)**

Add `&` before your selector to properly scope it:

```tsx
const Container = styled.div`
  & h1 {
    color: red;
  }
`;
```

**Option 2: Enable native CSS transpilation mode**

Switch to native CSS transpilation mode, which doesn't require CSS Modules scoping:

```js title="next.config.js"
export default withYak({
  experiments: {
    transpilationMode: 'Css'
  }
}, nextConfig);
```

See the [Migration to native CSS](/docs/migration-to-native-css) guide for more details.

## Can I reference a component in another component?

Yes, you can reference it in the tagged template literal the same way you would to it with styled-components.

```jsx title="my-component.tsx"
import { styled } from 'next-yak';

const Button = styled.button`
	background: #BF4F74;
`;

const Nav = styled.nav`
	background: #BF4F74;
	${Button} {
		color: white;
	}
`;
```

## Why does next-yak always generate CSS variables when the values are static references that are known at build time?

It's very hard to determine statically if a value is static or dynamic. We decided to always generate CSS variables to be on the safe side
and add errors if we detect that a value is static but a CSS variable is used.

## Can I use next-yak with TypeScript?

Yes, `next-yak` is fully type safe.

## Can I contribute to next-yak?

Yes.

We are happy about every contribution. Just write an issue or a pull request [here](https://github.com/DigitecGalaxus/next-yak)

## My styles are not applied

If your styles are not applied, the first thing you should check is the transformed output of your component.
In order to do that, you can enable the `debug` option in the `withYak` function.

<Tabs items={['next.config.ts',, 'next.config.js', 'next.config.mjs']}>
<Tab value="next.config.ts">
```ts
export default withYak({
  experiments: {
    debug: {
      filter: (path: string) => path.includes("myPage"),
      type: "all", // or "css" or "js"
    },
  },
}nextConfig);
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="next.config.js">
```js
module.exports = withYak({
  experiments: {
    debug: {
      filter: (path: string) => path.includes("myPage"),
      type: "all", // or "css" or "js"
    },
  },
}nextConfig);
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="next.config.mjs">
```js
export default withYak({
  experiments: {
    debug: {
      filter: (path: string) => path.includes("myPage"),
      type: "all", // or "css" or "js"
    },
  },
}nextConfig);
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

This will log the transformed output of your component to the console.

It could be a specificity issue, a wrong selector, or a wrong usage of the library and if you don't know why your styles are not applied, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/DigitecGalaxus/next-yak/issues/new/choose).
